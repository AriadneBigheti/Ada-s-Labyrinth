# Adas-Labyrinth

This playground is an adventure of a young girl, Ada, through the world of Computer Science.
To do it, I was inspired in Ada Lovelace, Isaac Asimov's robot's stories, The myth of Theseus and the Minotaur and Ariadne's thread, so you'll find a lot of references to them.
Ada's Labyrinth represents the paths, full of challenges, that we need to cross while coding. Many times we need to make mistakes, and go through a wrong way, in order to achieve our goals and get to the right path, always using logic.
On the other hand, I wanted to show with this Playground that a girl with a computer in hands has the power to change the world.

Websites that were often used when I was developing this playground:

PiskelApp, were I made all the Pixel Arts
Figma, were I prototiped and designed this project
StackOverflow, for coding issues

Everything else in this project was designed, coded and ilustrated by me, Ariadne Bigheti :)

Also, I want to thank my family, friends and mentors who guided me through the labyrinth that was developing this project. 
Please, enjoy the adventure.
